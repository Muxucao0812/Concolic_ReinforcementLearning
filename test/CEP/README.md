## Changing the program loaded into memory

Now that you have simulated the provided program or built and run an FPGA implementation of the default program, you may want to simulate/run your own programs.  In order to do that, you will need to write (in C or assembly), compile (using the OR1K gcc toolchain and newlib), and convert the resulting binary into a vmem file suitable for loading directly to memory.

Here are the basic steps of the compile and conversion process:
* Compile your program using the [OR1K toolchain](http://opencores.org/or1k/OpenRISC_GNU_tool_chain)
* Convert the resulting binary file to a bin file using `or1k-elf-objcopy -O binary`
* Convert the bin file to a vmem file using the `bin2vmem` utility in `software/utils`
* Rename the resulting sram file `sram.vmem` and replace the file in `fpga_hardware/cores/ram_wb`
* If you get illegal instruction exceptions (0x700), you may need to move `sram.vmem` to `fpga_hardware/`

## Enabling/disabling cores
Modify via commenting/uncommenting the desired cores in fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-defines.v.

## Simulate using ModelSim
* Comment-out (`define SYNTHESIS) in fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-defines.v
* Run `vsim` to compile the Verilog files into the `work` library. If this is your first time trying to compile in ModelSim, you may need to create a `work` library (after you delete the empty one that points to nothing).
* Exit ModelSim
* Compile the desired program, convert it to a bin file, then convert the bin file to a vmem file.
* Copy the vmem file to fpga_hardware/sram.vmem
* Run `sh runVSIM.sh` in fpga_hardware
* Once vsim finishes loading the design, type `run -all`
* To change simulation parameters, such as VCD printing or test name, modify fpga_hardware/cores/bench/test-defines.v

## Synthesize using Vivado
* Uncomment the synthesis define in fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-defines.v
* Start Vivado and create a new project (ideally targeting the VC707 dev. board).
    * Targeting a different development board requires that you create a .xdc file (see fpga_hardware/backend/vc707.xdc for an example) with pinout and constraints for that board.  It may also require you to modify fpga_hardware/core/clkgen/clkgen.v if the input clock is not 200 MHz or doesn't use differential signaling.

## Adding a core to the SoC
* Add a define that will control whether the core is included in the SoC to fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-defines.v
* Add the core's bus address and width information to fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-params.v
   * Use the Ethernet core as an example
   * Make sure to use an available address prefix for "XX_wb_adr"
   * Refer to the number of bytes actually used by the new core's bus interface to determine the address width
   * All other widths are the default of 32 bits
   * Update the configuration of the appropriate bus(es) (i.e., instruction, data, byte-wide)
      * Increment the number of slaves
      * Insert the new core in an empty slot (the data bus can hold up to 16 slaves)
         * If the desired bus doesn't have an empty slot, the easiest thing to do is to steal a slot from another slave.  Failing that, the bus arbiter (e.g., fpga_hardware/cores/arbiter/arbiter_dbus.v) will need to be modified to support more slaves.
* In cores/top/orpsoc_top.v
   * Add any pin connections required by the new core to the interface of this module
   * Create a set of bus slave wires to connect the new core and the appropriate bus arbiter
   * Connect the new core to the appropriate slot in the appropriate aribter using the wires created in the previous step
   * Update the bus aribter's defparams both in terms of numbering and adding defparams for the new core's "adr" and "add_width" parameters (this may already be done for data bus slaves up to the 16th slave).
   * Use conditional compilation statements and the define created earlier to conditionally instantiate the new core
      * Drive slave outputs to 0's if new core not defined
   * If the new core has an interrupt line, using the define, conditionally connect it to the processor's interrupt controller
* If the core requires pin I/O connections:
   * Bring the signals up through the hierarchy
   * Add the pinout information to the appropiate .xdc file in fpga_hardware/backend/
* Add the HDL files to the list of project files in ModelSim and re-compile
* Add the HDL files to the list of project files in Vivado and re-build

## Addressing the accelerators

The accelerator cores are accessed via memory-mapped IO.  That is to say, you read from and write to accelerator cores just as you would memory, using word granularity addresses.  The base address for each core is defined for hardware in `fpga_hardware/cores/top/orpsoc-params.v` and for software in the header file for that core, e.g., `fpga_hardware/cores/aes/AES.h`.  Also defined in the software header file are aliases for specific offesets in a core's interface.  To understand how the hardware and software work together, see the Wishbone bus interface for the core, e.g., `fpga_hardware/cores/aes/aes_top.v`.
